WIP

Codeine currently uses Inter as its only font with sans-serif as a fallback. You will have to include it in your project yourself, if you choose to use it. Just import a css-file with the following contents:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter:400');
```

Or import it via head-tag in your html-file, whichever fits your use-case best.
